# Verbify

Welcome to Verbify, your language learning platform designed to help users enhance their language skills through interactive experiences. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and other relevant information for developers.


## **Backend (MERN Stack):**



Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API and handling HTTP requests.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data, language content, and other application information.

Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to define schemas, validate data, and interact with the database from Node.js.

Passport.js: A authentication middleware for Node.js, used for implementing user authentication strategies such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

jsonwebtoken: A library for generating and verifying JWT tokens, used for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.

dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file, used for configuring sensitive information like database connection strings and secret keys.

### React Router Routes

- **Home Page ("/")**:
  - Description: Landing page of the application.
  - Purpose: Introduce users to Verbify, provide an overview of language learning features, and encourage exploration.
  - Components: `HomePage`

- **Lesson Detail Page ("/lessons/:lessonId")**:
  - Description: Detailed view of a specific language learning lesson.
  - Purpose: Display comprehensive information about a lesson, including content, exercises, and supplementary materials.
  - Components: `LessonDetailPage`

- **Create Lesson Page ("/create-lesson")**:
  - Description: Form for creating a new language learning lesson.
  - Purpose: Allow educators or contributors to create and submit new lessons for inclusion in the Verbify curriculum.
  - Components: `CreateLessonPage`

- **404 Not Found Route ("*")**:
  - Description: Page displayed when a URL does not match any existing routes.
  - Purpose: Improve user experience by gracefully handling navigation errors and directing users back to relevant sections of the application.
  - Components: `NotFoundPage`


## React Architecture

Verbify follows a modular and scalable architecture, leveraging React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. The architecture consists of several key components and design patterns to ensure maintainability, reusability, and performance.


### Routing

Routing in Verbify is handled using React Router, which enables navigation between different views or pages within the application. Routes are defined using Route components, each corresponding to a specific URL path and rendering a corresponding component when matched.

### Styling

Styling in Verbify is achieved using a combination of CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components) and CSS preprocessors (e.g., SASS). This approach allows for encapsulation of styles within individual components and facilitates easier maintenance and customization of styles.


### Error Handling

Verbify incorporates error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle runtime errors and edge cases. This includes error boundaries, which are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead.

### Testing

Unit and integration testing are integral parts of the development process in Verbify. Testing is performed using tools such as Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and functionality of individual components and features.

### Deployment

Verbify is deployed using various deployment platforms such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the deployment process and ensure smooth delivery of updates to production environments.
